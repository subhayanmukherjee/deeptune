## Image-based parameter-tuning of a noise filter using Deep Learning

We explore a new direction in explainable Artificial Intelligence (AI). Most state-of-art deep-learning based noise removal algorithms involve some form of neural networks trained end-to-end (input: noisy image, output: clean image). Such methods are inexplicable "black-boxes" since we do not have a clear understanding of their inner workings and how change in input data distribution can affect their denoising performance. In contrast, this project proposes and validates a CNN-based method that tunes the parameter of a computer vision based (fully explainable) denoising algorithm based only on the noisy input image. Thus, we get the best of both worlds: explain-ability of vision and learning-based regression.
