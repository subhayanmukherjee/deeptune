## Image-based parameter-tuning of a noise filter using Deep Learning

This project explores a new direction in explainable Artificial Intelligence (AI). Most state-of-art deep-learning based noise removal algorithms involve some form of neural networks trained end-to-end (input: noisy image, output: clean image). Such methods are inexplicable "black-boxes" since we do not have a clear understanding of their inner workings and how change in input data distribution can affect their denoising performance. In contrast, this project proposes and validates a CNN-based method that tunes the parameter of a computer vision based (fully explainable) denoising algorithm based only on the noisy input image. Thus, we get the best of both worlds: explain-ability of vision and learning-based regression.

## Guidelines

1. Build the training dataset by running the [dataset script](https://github.com/subhayanmukherjee/deeptune/blob/master/create_assorted_dataset_LNET.py) create_assorted_dataset_LNET.py, setting ```train = True``` for the desired *noise_lvl* inside the script. The script is written in a way that allows you to source images files with two different extensions from two folders while building the training dataset. This is similar to what we do in our [paper](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-27202-9_10).
2. To use the [GPU implementation of BM3D (BM3D-GPU)](https://github.com/DawyD/bm3d-gpu), as in our [paper](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-27202-9_10), compile the required binaries. Then, set ```bm3d_cpu = False``` inside the [dataset script](https://github.com/subhayanmukherjee/deeptune/blob/master/create_assorted_dataset_LNET.py) and set the *bm3dobj_loc* path to your compiled BM3D-GPU binary path.
3. The [model script](https://github.com/subhayanmukherjee/deeptune/blob/master/LNet.py) LNet.py has the implementation of the CNN we use to predict the &#955;<sub>3D</sub> parameter in our [paper](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-27202-9_10).
4. Run the [training script](https://github.com/subhayanmukherjee/deeptune/blob/master/learn_predict_L3d_noisysrc.py) learn_predict_L3d_noisysrc.py by similarly setting the *noise_lvl* and ```bm3d_cpu = False``` as before.
5. If you want to evaluate the trained model on a batch of images, you can create your test dataset by running the [dataset script](https://github.com/subhayanmukherjee/deeptune/blob/master/create_assorted_dataset_LNET.py) create_assorted_dataset_LNET.py, after setting ```train = False``` for the desired *noise_lvl* inside the script, along with ```bm3d_cpu = False``` and the *bm3dobj_loc* path as before. Then, you can run the [evaluation script](https://github.com/subhayanmukherjee/deeptune/blob/master/eval_L3d_noisysrc.py) eval_L3d_noisysrc.py *twice*, first to generate the predicted &#955;<sub>3D</sub> values for the test images, and then to evaluate BM3D performance (MSE and SSIM) using the predicted &#955;<sub>3D</sub> values, by changing *Line 76* to ```if False:```.
